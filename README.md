Script For the Module 4 challenge

## Analysis Summary

The goal of this script is to reorder and oraganize the data to better read it and draw conclusions about the spending habits and priorities of the school board and Mayor. In this script, we determine the passing rates of the various schools and sort by various criteria to determine the top (and bottom) performing schools. These scores are sorted by school at first, but we proceed to then sort by grade, amount of money the schools have spent, the size of the schools, and the type of the schools.

## Conclusion

The first conclusion I drew was that Cabrera High School was the top performing school in the district. I reached this conclusion by seeing in the top_schools dataframe that it had the highest overall passing rate at about 91.33 percent. Observing this dataframe, I notice that the top five schools are all Charter schools suggesting Charter schools produce better test scores.

This leads to my scond conclusion that charter schools are better for the success of their students. I drew this from the type_summary dataframe that shows that the overall passing rate of charter schools is nearly 40 percent more than district schools.
